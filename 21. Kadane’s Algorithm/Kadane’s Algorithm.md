From the figure above, we see that the local_maximum[4] is equal to 3 which is the sum of the subarray [4, -1]. Now have a look at the subarrays ending with A[5]. Youâ€™ll notice that these subarrays can be divided into two parts, the subarrays ending with A[4] (highlighted with yellow) and the single element subarray A[5] (in green).
